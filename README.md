# Doc2Vec TensorFlow Implementation

This project implements the Doc2Vec model using TensorFlow. Doc2Vec is an extension of Word2Vec that learns document embeddings in addition to word embeddings. In this implementation, we focus on training a Doc2Vec model for document similarity tasks.

## Overview

The Doc2Vec model is a neural network-based approach to learn vector representations of documents in an unsupervised manner. This implementation uses TensorFlow to build and train the Doc2Vec model.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (>=2.0)
- Pandas
- NumPy

## Project structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- data/: Directory to store input datasets.
- train.py: Contains the source code and script for the Doc2Vec model and trining.
